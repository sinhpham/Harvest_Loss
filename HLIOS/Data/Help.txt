Measuring Harvesting Losses
This app can help estimate seed losses during harvest by converting the seed amount from a known sampling area to a loss per acre.  It can be used for combine operation, or for other shattering losses.

Combine Losses:
1. Be sure to turn off the chopper/spreader so all combine losses are concentrated over the sieve width only
2. Place collection pan under combine during normal operation and allow sieve and straw residue to deposit.
3. Remove straw and clean sample in pan
4. Measure weight or volume of seed in sample, or count seeds
5. Start Harvest Loss app
6. Choose Loss Assessment Method
7. Select Crop.  The app chooses the bushel weight and seed weight.  Seed weight can be changed.
8. Enter the cut width in feet
9. Enter the sieve width in inches
The app calculates the concentration factor (cut/sieve) from these measurements

10. Enter Collecting Area in square feet
11. Enter Seed Loss value according to the selected Assessment Method
12. "Yield" and "Price" entries are optional
13. Output is calculated
14. The "Back" button reverts to the previous screen without erasing values, allowing for successive measurements

Shattering Losses:
1. Choose any Assessment Method
2. Select Cut and Sieve widths that result in a Concentration factor of 1.0, recalling the units of each, i.e., Cut = 1 ft, Sieve = 12 In
3. Proceed as above
